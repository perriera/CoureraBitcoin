This repo is the ScroogeCoin programming assignment practice of "Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies" online course.

This amazing course is created by the professors of Princeton University. It's free on the internet. The course has a series of well-organized lecture videos and programming practices after each lecture. I encourage anyone who is interested in cryptocurrency to attend this travis-ci onlie course. You will get a chance to learn the theories and technical details behind the popular Bitcoin and may even create your own version of cryptocurrency after finishing this course!
